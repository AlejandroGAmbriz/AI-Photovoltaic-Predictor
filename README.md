# AI-Photovoltaic-Predictor
This project focuses on photovoltaic energy prediction using **intelligent models**.

## 游닄 Implemented Models

The system applies three approaches:

  - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)

  - **SVM** (Support Vector Machine)

  - **Random Forest**

## 游늯 Input Data

The models are trained and evaluated using:

Photovoltaic production data

Climatological data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, solar radiation, wind speed, precipitation)

## 游꿢 Objective

The main goal is to predict the future energy production of a photovoltaic plant based on meteorological variables, supporting more efficient decision-making in the renewable energy sector.

## 游뱋 Contributions

Contributions are welcome.
